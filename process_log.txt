================================================================================
SESSION 1: Initial MVP and Learning
================================================================================

PROMPT 1:
"can you build me a the MVP for a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to search for recipes using TheMealDB API? The application will display search results and allow users to view detailed recipe information. also structure the repository in the following way:
project/
├── index.html
├── css/
│ └── styles.css
├── js/
│ └── app.js
├── Dockerfile
└── nginx.conf"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Created full project structure with index.html, css/styles.css, js/app.js, Dockerfile, and nginx.conf
- Used TheMealDB API endpoints (search.php and lookup.php) for searching and viewing recipes
- Built a responsive card grid for search results using CSS Grid
- Implemented detail view showing ingredients, instructions, and YouTube video link
- Configured Dockerfile with nginx:alpine to serve the SPA
- Used async/await with fetch() for all API calls

WHAT I LEARNED / NOTES:
- After each prompt, I like to go back in and evaluate all the code generated by Claude
- I like to understand what each part of the code does
- I found it interesting that the Docker config listens on port 80 (8080), which relates to what we learned in class about port 80 being the default network port for HTTP
- I am surprised that Claude made it very similar to what the professor expected, given only a very simple prompt
- Good coding practice is to firstly define all const variables / query all DOM elements that we must modify at the top of the page

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- Clicking on the "Search" button without entering a keyword does not display an error message indicating the field is required
- Result menu cards do not display category of the meal

HOW I FIXED IT:
- Search bar validation: prompted Claude -> PROMPT 4
- Menu card category: added the following code snippet to my renderResults function:
```<span class="card-category">${meal.strCategory}</span>```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 2:
"what is the purpose / when should i use async/await functions?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Overview of what issue async/await solves in Javascript
- When programmers should use async/await

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Using async/await is for when you need to wait for something (whether that's I/O, API call, file reading, DB querying, etc.) but you want it to run asynchronously while the rest of your code runs
- Without async/await, the whole screen would freeze and wait for the API call to finish, and we do not want this for the user

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED / HOW I FIXED IT:
- Not applicable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 3:
"how come the event in this code snippet needs to be async? ```searchForm.addEventListener("submit", async (e) =>{...})```"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Deeper explanations on async/await mechanisms/usage

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Because within the block scope of this anonymous function, there is a line of code that uses await
- await can only be used inside an async function
- Without await, network requests returns a pending Promise object, but we want the object itself

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED / HOW I FIXED IT:
- Not applicable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 4:
"can you write me code that will display an error message or a tool tip indicating that the field is required if the user presses on the search button without entering a keyword?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Added a span that consists of an error tool tip that is originally hidden (has the hidden CSS class)
- Added an event listener to the search input that hide the tooltip if the user starts typing into the searchbar 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Use span instead of div for one line elements
- The hidden class is very helpful for displaying/not displaying HTML elements that will be dynamically shown/hidden during runtime

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- No subsequent issues stemmed from this

CODE SNIPPET I USED:
```
<span id="error-tooltip" class="error-tooltip hidden">Please enter a search term</span>
```
```
searchInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
  searchInput.classList.remove("input-error");
  errorTooltip.classList.add("hidden");
});
```
as suggested by Claude

================================================================================
SESSION 2: Styling and UI
================================================================================

PROMPT 5:
"for the searchbar and search button, can you make the bounder slightly rounded and add shadowing?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Changed CSS rules for search input and search button

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Shadowing and border radius can be manipulated using border-radius and box-shadow

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- No subsequent issues stemmed from this

CODE SNIPPET I USED:
```
#search-input {
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
#search-form button {
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 6:
"instead of the orange color now, can you make the website colors be blue/purple gradient?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Introduced background: linear-gradient in the CSS file

WHAT I LEARNED:
- I never knew it was this easy to create gradient color using CSS (linear-gradient property)

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- I wanted to change the color of the "Watch on YouTube" and category displays as well to produce a more cohesive UI

HOW I FIXED IT:
- prompted Claude -> PROMPT 7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 7:
"for the youtube video element, can we write a more descriptive name such as "Watch on YouTube" and color that element to the same blue/purple gradient?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Updated the background color for the video element
- Declared padding that is the size of the background around the Watch on YouTube text

WHAT I LEARNED:
- To encase any element/text in a container with a background color, I can simply define padding and set the background-color rule

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- No subsequent issues stemmed from this

CODE SNIPPET I USED:
```
.recipe-detail .video-link {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a6cf7, #7b2ff7);
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 4px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 8:
"on the menu cards, can you put a slightly larger gap between name and category?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Changed the card class vertical padding from 0.25rem to 0.5rem

WHAT I LEARNED:
- I initially thought the "gap" CSS rule would be used, but changing the vertical padding is enough and works for this prompt

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- No subsequent issues stemmed from this

CODE SNIPPET I USED:
```
.card h3 {
  padding: 0.75rem 0.75rem 0.5rem;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 9:
"can you add a "clear results" functionality that removed text from the searchbar and resets the search result page?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Added a button element next to the search button that allowed user to clear results

WHAT I LEARNED:
- I implemented this because I thought it would be useful
- I should be more specific with which element I want my functionality to be
- Since this is now an anchor element, default link behavior in JS results in leaving the current page and redirecting to what's specified in "href"
- Need to add event listener and e.preventDefault(); to the clear results link to prevent default link behavior

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- I wanted an anchor element instead of a button matching the search input button

HOW I FIXED IT:
- Prompted claude to use an anchor element instead
- Anchor element "Clear results" displays as a small hyperlink underneath the searchbar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 9:
"my redeployed application does not have some changes on to it, for example the updated color from orange to blue/purple gradient. why is this happening?"

AI RESPONSE SUMMARY:
- Explained it's most likely a browser cache issue
- Gave instructions for me to hard refresh

WHAT I LEARNED:
- Even after a deployment, my browser could be serving the old cached CSS file instead of fetching the updated one from the server
- Hotkey for MacOS (Cmd + Shift + R) hard refreshes in Chrome to bypass the cache

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- No subsequent issues stemmed from this

HOW I FIXED IT:
- Cmd + Shift + R

================================================================================
REFLECTION
================================================================================

Most useful AI assistance:
- Explaining nitty-gritty JS concepts to me and showing the code snippets where they occur
- For example: Explaining the purpose of async/await
- I appreciate that Claude can look through each of my repository files for comprehensive assistance

What I would do differently:
- Next time, I should start with more specific code-generation prompts instead of broadly: "build me an MVP"
- This way, I could be more collaborative on the coding process instead of starting with an MVP -> then going back into refine details
- My first prompt should contain requirements/understanding the requirements of my project first, flush those out, then move onto actual code generation

Notes:
- As an AI engineering student, it's been a while since I had the opportunity to code with vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript
- I almost forgot how fun it is
- It was also cool to learn how to deploy to GCP and have a service URL that was not my usual Github deployment URL
- I value going over edge cases and testing each step of the development process before moving on to the next

Time spent: ~5 hours
